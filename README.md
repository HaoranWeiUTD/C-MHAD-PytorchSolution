# C-MHAD-PytorchSolution
This is an Pytorch Solution for sensor fusion based continuous action detection

In these 3 folder, are solutions using video only, inertial only and Fusion approach.
All of the 3 solutions using sliding window to find the action of interest, this sliding window takes 3 seconds, and moving in 0.2 second.
The fusion approach is a 2 input network, using the same structure from indivudual modality.
